# BeerRecommender
Beer Recommender System from Kaggle Data.
This project aims to combine two datasets on kaggle:

One that uses Natural Language Processing to turn reviews into numeric taste profiles

The Second compiled over 1.5million reviews of Beer Ratings

From the combined data set a recommender system will be created to recommend Beers based on users rating history.
Depending on the success of the project I may also try and add some fun little features.
